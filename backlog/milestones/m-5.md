## Description
Implement marketplace for browsing gigs and artists with filtering, search, and infinite scroll.

## Goals
- Gig listing endpoint with filters and pagination
- Artist discovery endpoint with filters
- Global search endpoint (artists + gigs only, D-071)
- Frontend marketplace pages with infinite scroll (D-017)
- Single-click gig application (D-077)

## Success Criteria
- Users can browse gigs with filters (genre, location, date, price)
- Users can browse artists with filters
- Search returns relevant results for artists and gigs
- Infinite scroll loads more results automatically
- "Apply to Gig" sends profile + rates with one click

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend: All marketplace endpoints (gigs, artists, search, apply) fully independent
- Frontend: Marketplace page can be built once listing endpoints exist
- Components (GigCard, ArtistCard) can be built in parallel
