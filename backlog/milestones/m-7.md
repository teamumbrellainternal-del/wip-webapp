## Description
Implement cloud storage system for artists to upload, organize, and manage files with 50GB quota enforcement.

## Goals
- File upload endpoint with R2 signed URL generation
- File listing, organization, and deletion endpoints
- Files page with upload interface and file browser
- Storage quota tracking and enforcement (50GB per artist, D-026)

## Success Criteria
- Users can upload files (audio, video, images, documents)
- Files display in organized list with metadata
- Users can delete files to free space
- 50GB quota enforced and displayed
- No upload count limit (only size limit)

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend: Upload URL generation and file CRUD can be built separately
- Frontend: File manager page can start once upload endpoint exists
- Quota tracking can be added independently
