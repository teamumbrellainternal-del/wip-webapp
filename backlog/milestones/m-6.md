## Description
Build the in-app messaging system for communication between artists, including conversation management and message delivery.

## Goals
- Conversation creation and listing endpoints
- Message send/receive endpoints with 2000 char limit (D-043)
- Messages page with thread list and message view
- File attachment support for messages
- "Book Artist" pre-filled inquiry (D-076)

## Success Criteria
- Users can start new conversations
- Users can send/receive messages up to 2000 chars
- Messages display in threaded view
- File attachments work correctly
- "Book Artist" button opens composer with template

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend: Conversation and message endpoints have dependencies (conversation first, then messages)
- Frontend: Messages page can start once conversation endpoint exists
- Book Artist feature can be built independently
