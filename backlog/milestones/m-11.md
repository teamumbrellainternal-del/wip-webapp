## Description
Ensure production readiness with legal compliance, security hardening, error handling, and user experience polish. This milestone addresses critical gaps that would block production launch or expose legal/security risks.

## Goals
- Legal compliance (Terms/Privacy/Cookies, account deletion)
- Security hardening (rate limiting, CORS, input sanitization)
- Production monitoring (health checks, backups, rollback procedures)
- User experience polish (404 pages, loading states, error messages)
- SEO foundation (meta tags, favicons)
- Clerk integration validation (email verification, webhook resilience)

## Success Criteria
- Legal pages deployed and linked in footer
- Cookie consent banner functional
- Account deletion flow enables user data removal
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse
- All inputs sanitized against injection attacks
- Health check endpoint enables monitoring
- Database backup strategy documented
- Custom error pages deployed
- SEO meta tags on all public pages
- Clerk webhook failures handled gracefully

## Deliverables
- ✅ Legal compliance complete (Terms/Privacy/Cookies/Account Deletion)
- ✅ Security hardened (rate limiting, CORS, input sanitization)
- ✅ Monitoring enabled (health checks, backups, rollback docs)
- ✅ User experience polished (error pages, loading states, messages)
- ✅ SEO foundation laid (meta tags, favicons)
- ✅ Clerk integration validated (email verification, webhook resilience)
