## Description
Establish comprehensive documentation infrastructure and developer tooling to enable fast, surgical changes post-MVP. Create living documentation that maps API surface, database relationships, and component usage to reduce agent context re-ingestion and accelerate client feedback iteration.

## Goals
- Auto-generate API surface map from codebase
- Document database schema with endpoint relationships
- Catalog UI components with props and usage patterns
- Organize TypeScript interfaces for agent consumption
- Deploy preview environment for client testing
- Configure auto-documentation updates on code changes

## Success Criteria
- API Surface Map documents all 50+ endpoints with contracts
- Database Schema shows table relationships and endpoint mappings
- Component Catalog covers all reusable UI components
- TypeScript interfaces consolidated in machine-readable format
- Preview environment accessible at preview.umbrella.app
- Auto-documentation workflow runs on every push to main
- Surgical changes require <5 files ingested (vs entire codebase)

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Tasks 11.1, 11.2, 11.3 can run in parallel (all documentation generation)
- Task 11.4 can run parallel with 11.1-11.3 (just organizing existing files)
- Task 11.5 (preview env) can run parallel with all docs tasks
- Task 11.6 must wait for 11.1-11.3 complete (needs scripts to exist)

## Critical Notes
**DO NOT** use CodeWiki or similar repository-level documentation tools - they're overkill for a business application. Use targeted Claude Code prompts to generate exactly what's needed: API contracts, database relationships, and component usage.

**ARCHITECTURE.md** will be created manually by comparing completed implementation against initial PRD, architecture documents, and Figma handoff to verify all requirements met.

## Deliverables
- ✅ docs/API_SURFACE.md - Complete endpoint documentation
- ✅ docs/DATABASE.md - Schema relationships and endpoint mappings
- ✅ docs/COMPONENTS.md - UI component catalog with props
- ✅ types/ directory - Organized TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Preview environment deployed and accessible
- ✅ Auto-documentation GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md (manual verification against requirements)
