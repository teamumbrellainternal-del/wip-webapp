## Description
Integrate Claude API for Violet AI toolkit with prompt templates, usage tracking, and rate limiting (50 prompts/day per artist, D-062).

## Goals
- Violet prompt endpoint with Claude API integration
- Usage tracking in KV for daily rate limiting
- Prompt template system for different use cases
- Violet toolkit page with intent picker modal (D-058)

## Success Criteria
- "Ask Violet to Draft" calls Claude API successfully
- Usage limited to 50 prompts per day per artist
- Usage counter displays remaining prompts
- Different prompt templates for various contexts
- Intent picker modal guides users to toolkit features

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend: Prompt endpoint and usage tracking can be built separately
- Frontend: Toolkit page and intent picker independent
- Template system can be built independently
