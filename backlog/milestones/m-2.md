## Description
Build the complete 5-step artist onboarding process that collects all required profile information. This is the critical path for new user acquisition.

## Goals
- Backend API endpoints for all 5 onboarding steps
- Frontend pages for each onboarding step
- Progress validation and step transitions
- Database schema population for new artists

## Success Criteria
- New users complete all 5 steps without errors
- Data persists to D1 database correctly
- Users redirected to dashboard after step 5
- Profile marked as onboarding_complete = true

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend: All 5 step endpoints can be built simultaneously (independent routes)
- Frontend: All 5 step pages can be built simultaneously (similar structure)
- Backend and frontend work can overlap completely
