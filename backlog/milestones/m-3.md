## Description
Implement artist profile viewing and editing with the 6-tab system, including track playback, media display, and review management.

## Goals
- Profile view endpoint and page (public profiles)
- Profile edit endpoint and separate route (D-022)
- 6-tab navigation system (Bio, Tracks, Media, Reviews, etc.)
- Track upload and inline playback functionality
- Avatar upload with R2 signed URLs

## Success Criteria
- Artists can view any public profile
- Artists can edit their own profile on separate route
- Tracks play inline with audio player (D-024)
- Profile data updates persist to D1
- No track upload limit enforced (D-026)

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend: All profile endpoints (GET, PUT, avatar, tracks, reviews) independent
- Frontend: Profile view and edit pages can be built in parallel
- Track player component can be built independently
