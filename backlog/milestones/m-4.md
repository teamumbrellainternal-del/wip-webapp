## Description
Build the artist dashboard with daily batch metrics, welcome messaging, and marketplace preview.

## Goals
- Analytics aggregation endpoint with daily batch logic
- Dashboard page with metrics cards
- Latest 3 gigs from marketplace display (D-011)
- Cron job setup for midnight UTC updates (D-008)

## Success Criteria
- Dashboard loads without errors for authenticated users
- Metrics display (earnings, gig count, profile views, followers)
- "New Opportunities" shows 3 latest marketplace gigs
- Daily batch cron job configured in wrangler.toml

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend: Analytics endpoint and spotlight feature independent
- Frontend: Dashboard page can start once analytics endpoint exists
- Cron job setup is independent
