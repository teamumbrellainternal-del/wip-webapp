## Description
Comprehensive testing of all user flows, bug fixing, performance optimization, and production deployment to Cloudflare Workers.

## Goals
- Integration tests for critical user flows
- Bug fixes identified during testing
- Performance optimization (caching, query optimization)
- Production deployment with environment configuration
- Post-deployment verification

## Success Criteria
- All 26 screens from eng-spec functional
- Critical path works end-to-end (signup → dashboard)
- No P0/P1 bugs remain
- Application deployed to production
- All design decisions (D-001 to D-110) verified

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Testing: Integration tests can be written throughout sprint
- Optimization: Can identify opportunities while building
- Deployment: Staging deployment can happen before final testing
