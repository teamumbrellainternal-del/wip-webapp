## Description
Build artist communication tools: SMS/Email broadcast system for fan messaging and Creative Studio journal with block-based editor.

## Goals
- Broadcast endpoint with Resend/Twilio integration
- Contact list management endpoints
- Journal CRUD endpoints with block-based storage
- Message Fans page with AI draft integration (D-046)
- Creative Studio page with journal editor

## Success Criteria
- Artists can send text-only broadcasts via email/SMS (D-049)
- "Ask Violet to Draft" generates message content
- Broadcasts sent successfully via Resend and Twilio
- Journal entries saved with block-based format
- Journal supports manual media upload (D-028)

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend: Broadcast, contact lists, and journal endpoints all independent
- Frontend: Message Fans and Journal pages can be built in parallel
- Service integrations (Resend/Twilio) independent from routes
