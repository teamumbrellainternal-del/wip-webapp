## Description
Implement core authentication using Cloudflare Access OAuth (Apple/Google only) with JWT validation and session management. This milestone establishes the security foundation for the entire application.

## Goals
- OAuth callback handling for Apple and Google
- JWT validation and session storage in KV
- Session lifecycle management (creation, validation, destruction)
- Onboarding state tracking for incomplete registrations

## Success Criteria
- Users can authenticate via Apple/Google OAuth
- Sessions persist across page refreshes
- Invalid/expired tokens are rejected
- Incomplete onboarding redirects to step 1 (per D-006)

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Backend: All auth endpoints (3 routes) can be built simultaneously
- Frontend: Login page and auth hooks can be built in parallel with backend
- Middleware can start once session validation endpoint exists
