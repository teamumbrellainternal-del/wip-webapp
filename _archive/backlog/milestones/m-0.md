## Description
Establish foundational contracts, infrastructure, and seed data before parallel development begins. This phase prevents integration failures, defines shared standards, and unblocks all downstream work.

## Goals
- Apply and validate all database migrations
- Define comprehensive API contracts for all endpoints
- Create mock implementations for external services (Resend, Twilio, Claude, R2)
- Document session structure for auth implementation

## Success Criteria
- All 7 database migrations applied and validated in D1
- API contract document (`docs/API_CONTRACT.md` or `openapi.yaml`) created and reviewed
- Session structure documented in `docs/SESSIONS.md`
- Mock implementations available in `api/mocks/index.ts`
- All mocks tested with sample calls
- Team briefed on API contracts and mock usage

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- All 3 tasks (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) can run simultaneously (no dependencies)
- With 3 agents: Phase 0 completes in ~2 hours
- With 1 agent: Phase 0 completes in ~5 hours

## Critical Notes
**DO NOT START M1 UNTIL PHASE 0 IS COMPLETE**

This phase addresses 6 critical blocking issues identified in REFINEMENT_REPORT_pt2.md:
1. Database migrations must be applied before any backend work
2. API contracts prevent frontend/backend integration failures
3. Mocks enable development without waiting for M10 real service integration
4. Session structure resolves task-1.1/task-1.2 dependency ambiguity

## Deliverables
- ✅ Database schema validated and ready
- ✅ API contract shared with all developers
- ✅ Session structure documented
- ✅ External service mocks ready for use
- ✅ Team alignment on contracts and standards
