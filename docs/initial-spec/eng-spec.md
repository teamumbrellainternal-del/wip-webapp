## DESIGN DECISIONS (FINALIZED)

This section documents all critical product decisions made during the scoping phase. Each decision is tagged with its ID for traceability.

### Authentication & Onboarding

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-001** | Use only Apple/Google OAuth via Cloudflare Access; remove email/password auth | Reduces complexity, leverages Cloudflare Access JWT validation, eliminates password reset flows |
| **D-003** | All 5 onboarding steps required (enforce progression) | Ensures data quality and complete artist profiles; high-quality input = better platform experience |
| **D-004** | Allow exit from onboarding but restart from beginning on return | Simplifies state management; no partial progress saving in MVP |
| **D-006** | Redirect incomplete OAuth users to Step 1 on return | Consistent with D-004; ensures complete onboarding before dashboard access |

### Dashboard & Metrics

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-008** | Daily batch updates at midnight UTC for all metrics | Reduces database load and Worker CPU costs; real-time not critical for MVP |
| **D-010** | ‚ÄúUrgent‚Äù badge: Gigs within 7 days with <50% capacity filled | Rule-based logic; balances urgency with venue capacity needs |
| **D-011** | ‚ÄúNew Opportunities‚Äù: Show latest 3 gigs from marketplace | Simple, non-personalized; avoids empty states from failed matching |
| **D-012** | Same as D-011 (no separate logic for opportunities selection) | Consistency with D-011 |

### Marketplace

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-014** | Default gig sort: Random shuffle | Encourages exploration of diverse venues; prevents payment-driven sorting bias |
| **D-017** | Infinite scroll for marketplace listings | Mobile-friendly UX; modern pattern for content discovery |

### Artist Profile

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-022** | Separate /profile/edit route for editing | Clean separation of public view vs.¬†edit mode; easier permission logic |
| **D-023** | Profile actions menu: ‚ÄúEdit Profile‚Äù if own, ‚ÄúShare/Report‚Äù if other‚Äôs | Context-aware actions; prevents confusion |
| **D-024** | Track playback: Inline audio player | Faster UX; no navigation overhead for quick previews |
| **D-026** | No track upload limit (constrained by 50GB storage quota) | Natural constraint; avoids arbitrary limits |
| **D-028** | Media posts: Manual upload only (no social media import) | Reduces MVP complexity; defers Instagram/TikTok API integration to post-MVP |
| **D-032** | Reviews: Artists can invite anyone via email | Maximizes review quantity; trust via community validation |
| **D-034** | No review moderation in MVP | Minimal overhead; rely on community reporting if issues arise post-launch |

### Messaging

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-043** | Message character limit: 2000 characters | Prevents excessive messages; aligns with SMS-like conciseness |
| **D-087** | No rate limits on in-app messaging | Low spam risk in vetted artist community; simplifies MVP |
| **D-088** | No spam/abuse prevention in MVP | Monitor manually; add flag-based system post-MVP if needed |

### Artist Toolbox

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-044** | Toolbox access: Header navigation item ‚ÄúTools‚Äù | Prominent placement; always accessible |
| **D-046** | ‚ÄúAsk Violet to Draft‚Äù: Real AI generation via Claude API | Delivers on Violet value prop; manageable cost with 50 prompt/day limit |
| **D-049** | Broadcast messages: Text-only in MVP | Simplifies email templates; avoids attachment spam issues |

### Violet AI

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-058** | ‚ÄúStart Creating Together‚Äù: Opens intent picker modal | Guides user to relevant toolkit feature; clearer than direct chat |
| **D-062** | Violet usage limit: 50 prompts/day per artist | Cost control; generous for typical use while preventing abuse |

### Analytics & Growth

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-068** | Spotlight artists: Random verified artists with >4.5 rating | No complex algorithm; highlights quality artists |
| **D-070** | Fan Reach: Platform followers only | Avoids social media API dependencies; clear metric definition |
| **D-071** | Global search scope: Artists + Gigs | Core discovery needs; venues not in MVP scope |

### Booking & Payments

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-076** | ‚ÄúBook Artist‚Äù: Opens message composer with pre-filled inquiry | No complex booking form; flexible conversation-based booking |
| **D-077** | ‚ÄúApply to Gig‚Äù: Single-click apply sends profile + rates | Minimal friction; venues get full artist info immediately |
| **D-079** | Booking confirmation: Email + SMS to both parties | Multi-channel confirmation; reduces missed bookings |
| **D-080** | Gig completion: Either party can mark complete | Flexible; enables analytics even if one party is unresponsive |

### Account Settings

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-098** | Settings access: Profile avatar dropdown ‚Üí Settings | Standard UX pattern; easy discovery |
| **D-099** | Credential changes: Read-only (OAuth-based) | Email tied to OAuth provider; no password to change |
| **D-102** | Account deletion: Self-service automatic deletion | GDPR/CCPA best practice; user autonomy |

### Legal & Compliance

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-103** | Minimal compliance: Terms + Privacy Policy only | US-focused MVP; upgrade before EU expansion |
| **D-106** | Cookie disclosure: Simple banner ‚ÄúThis website uses cookies‚Äù | Minimal legal requirement; no consent mechanism needed for essential cookies |

### Business Model

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **D-109** | No public roadmap | Focus on MVP execution; gather user feedback post-launch before committing to features |
| **D-110** | Free forever, no premium tiers | Artist-friendly model; future monetization via venue commission or other channels |
