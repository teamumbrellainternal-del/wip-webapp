- [ ] Messaging conversation management (6 endpoints)
- [ ] File upload/download with R2 integration (6 endpoints)
- [ ] Broadcast message sending via Resend/Twilio (4 endpoints)
- [ ] Onboarding step submissions (6 endpoints)
- [ ] Analytics aggregation and retrieval (7 endpoints)

**Frontend Pages & Screens (50+ planned, 0 complete):**
- [ ] Authentication flow (sign in/up with OAuth)
- [ ] 5-step onboarding flow
- [ ] Artist dashboard with metrics
- [ ] Marketplace browsing (gigs + artists)
- [ ] Artist profile pages (6-tab view + edit mode)
- [ ] Messaging interface
- [ ] File manager
- [ ] Broadcast composer
- [ ] Violet AI interface
- [ ] Analytics dashboard
- [ ] Settings pages

**Critical Infrastructure Not Implemented:**

- [ ] Twilio SMS sending (booking confirmations, broadcasts)
- [ ] Claude API integration for Violet AI prompts
- [ ] R2 signed URL generation for file uploads/downloads
- [ ] Daily analytics aggregation cron job
- [ ] Profile view event tracking
- [ ] File upload validation
- [ ] Storage quota enforcement

---

### 7.2 Medium Priority (Feature Complete)

- [ ] Real-time WebSocket messaging (polling acceptable for MVP per D-021)
- [ ] Push notifications (post-MVP)
- [ ] Review moderation system (post-MVP per D-034)
- [ ] Spam/abuse prevention (post-MVP per D-088)
- [ ] Message rate limiting (post-MVP per D-087)
- [ ] Payment processing (post-MVP)
- [ ] Advanced analytics exports (post-MVP)
- [ ] AI matching algorithms (post-MVP)

---

### 7.3 Low Priority (Out of Scope)

- [ ] Venue/Collective onboarding (marked "Coming Soon")
- [ ] Social media content import
- [ ] Advanced file AI analysis (genre detection, etc.)
- [ ] Revenue forecasting
- [ ] P&L tracking
- [ ] Premium/paid tiers

---

## 8. DEPENDENCIES & BLOCKERS

### 8.1 External Service Configuration

**What's Needed:**
- [ ] Cloudflare Access OAuth provider setup (Apple & Google)
- [ ] Resend API account and key configuration
- [ ] Twilio account and credentials configuration
- [ ] Claude API key (Anthropic)

**Status:** Partially done (keys in env, no integration)

---

### 8.2 Development Environment Setup

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Node.js project structure
- ✅ TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Vite build system
- ✅ Tailwind CSS
- ✅ D1 migrations
- ✅ Wrangler Worker configuration

**What's Needed:**
- [ ] Database initialization in development environment
- [ ] Local Cloudflare Worker testing setup
- [ ] Frontend routing configuration
- [ ] API client setup (src/lib/api-client.ts exists but minimal)
- [ ] Authentication context/provider for React

---

## 9. KNOWN ISSUES & TECH DEBT

### 9.1 API Issues

1. **Placeholder Responses (Major)**
   - All non-auth endpoints return 501 "Not Implemented"
   - Need to implement ~31 endpoint handlers

2. **Authentication (Minor)**
   - Cloudflare Access JWT validation uses custom logic (should use Cloudflare's public keys in production)
   - Fallback to Authorization header is for development only

3. **Missing Implementations (Medium)**
   - File type validation not implemented
   - Storage quota enforcement missing
   - Rate limiting (non-Violet) not implemented

---

### 9.2 Database Issues

1. **Missing Event Tracking (Medium)**
   - Profile views not tracked (daily_metrics.profile_views needs event source)
   - Track plays counter exists but no play event tracking

2. **Missing Triggers (Low)**
   - Urgency flag for gigs should be auto-calculated (currently manual)
   - Spotlight artist logic requires cron job (not yet implemented)

---

### 9.3 Frontend Issues

1. **No Page Components (Critical)**
   - App.tsx is a placeholder showing only title
   - No routing setup (React Router missing)
   - No page components at all

2. **Missing Hooks (Medium)**
   - API hook exists but minimal (src/hooks/use-api.ts)
   - Form handling hooks not found
   - Pagination hook not found

3. **Component Library Status (Good)**
   - 80+ UI components available
   - All shadcn/ui components implemented
   - Layout components ready
   - But missing: block editor, audio player, infinite scroll wrapper

---
